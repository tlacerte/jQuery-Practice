# jQuery-Practice

The goals of this activity:
- As a User (AAU), I don't want to see any developer skills when the page first loads so that I can start with a fresh slate.
- AAU, I want to be able to type in a skill and have it added to my list of skills by clicking a button.
- AAU, I want to be able to remove an individual skill one at a time in case I make a mistake.
